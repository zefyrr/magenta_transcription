    "# Music Transcription with Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an interactive demo of a few [music transcription models](g.co/magenta/mt3) created by Google's [Magenta](g.co/magenta) team.  You can upload audio and have one of our models automatically transcribe it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://magenta.tensorflow.org/assets/transcription-with-transformers/architecture_diagram.png\" alt=\"Transformer-based transcription architecture\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook supports two pre-trained models:\n",
    "1. the piano transcription model from [our ISMIR 2021 paper](https://archives.ismir.net/ismir2021/paper/000030.pdf)\n",
    "1. the multi-instrument transcription model from [our ICLR 2022 paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=iMSjopcOn0p)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caveat**: neither model is trained on singing.  If you upload audio with vocals, you will likely get weird results.  Multi-instrument transcription is still not a completely-solved problem and so you may get weird results regardless.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, we hope you have fun transcribing!  Feel free to tweet any interesting output at [@GoogleMagenta](https://twitter.com/googlemagenta)...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions for running:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure to use a GPU runtime, click:  __Runtime >> Change Runtime Type >> GPU__\n",
    "* Press ▶️ on the left of each cell to execute the cell\n",
    "* In the __Load Model__ cell, choose either `ismir2021` for piano transcription or `mt3` for multi-instrument transcription\n",
    "* In the __Upload Audio__ cell, choose an MP3 or WAV file from your computer when prompted\n",
    "* Transcribe the audio using the __Transcribe Audio__ cell (it may take a few minutes depending on the length of the audio)\n",
